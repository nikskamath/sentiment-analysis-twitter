How to extract data from Twitter in R for sentiment analysis

The file twitter-extraction.R contains code for extracting data from Twitter using a created API key. In this example, data was extracted from Twitter of various publishers and their reviews, for sentiment analysis.

The file wiki-data-extraction.R contains code for web scraping data from Wikipedia. This example shows a table extracted of video games publishers from Wikipedia using R.

#The web scraping was done as part of the data extraction process (ETL) for one of my academic projects.
